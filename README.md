# Middleman Base

My preferred setup for Middleman. Work-in-progress atm.

* Twitter Bootstrap, Sass version
* Pow


## Getting Started

1. Install **middleman-base** as a Middleman template.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cabgfx/middleman-base.git ~/.middleman/middleman-base
    ```

2.  Initialize a new Middleman project with the **middleman-base** template

    ```bash
    middleman init project_name --template=middleman-base
    cd project_name
    ```

3. Install required gems: `bundle install`

4. Link a pow: `powder link`

5. Open `http://project_name.dev` and get cranking!


### Customize and/or clean up

When you've have successfully set up your new project with this template, you'll likely want to remove some shit you don't need, and add shit you do need. Other than that, everything should be good to go. Get shit done.
